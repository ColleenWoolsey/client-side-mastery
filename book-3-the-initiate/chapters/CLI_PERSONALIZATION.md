# Personalizing Bash

If you have Windows 10, or greater, then you can install the [bash subsystem](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10), which is a more powerful, developer-friendly terminal emulator like the ones that you Mac-using friends have.

## Autojump

Install the [autojump](https://github.com/wting/autojump) command line utility.

## Zsh Themes

There are many zsh themes that developers have produced over the years that will allow you to personalize how your terminal looks. A limited set are shown on the [oh-my-zsh wiki](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/themes). Try a few out to see what appeals to you the most.

There are also plugins that developers have produced to make zsh a more rich interface. Visit the [wiki page on plugins](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/Plugins) and see what they all do. At the minimum, we suggest activating the following plugins.

1. [git](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/Plugins#git)
2. [autojump](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/Plugins#autojump)
3. [npm](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/Plugins#npm)
4. [web-search](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/Plugins#web-search)

There's a plugin called [autojump](https://github.com/joelthelion/autojump) that allows you to easily switch between directories on your machine. Get it correctly installed, and if you've completed Challenge 1, enable the plugin in zsh.
