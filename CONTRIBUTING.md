# How to Contribute to the Course

First and foremost, thank you for your interest in contributing to our open coursework. We are community-driven, and that includes the community of instructors, coaches, junior instructors, teaching assistants, alumni, and current students that want to ensure that the content and exercises are high quality.

## Pull Request

All changes must happen through a pull request. If you are an internal contributor (you work for NSS), then a standard pull request from your feature branch, which follows our PR guidelines, is all you need. If you are an external contributor, then please fork the repository, and submit a pull request from your forked master branch to our master branch. External contributors must follow the External Contributor Pull Request Guidelines so that we can clearly understand your rationale for the changes.

Please note that changes from parties external to NSS will have more stringent requirements since we are unable to discuss and/or see the results of your experimentation ourselves unless you have involved our staff with your experiment from its inception through to its completion.
